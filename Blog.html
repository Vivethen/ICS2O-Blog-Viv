        <p>Today we started making our blog. I am learning how to make a button on khan academy. 
            I am strugling a bit but am still making progress.</p>

        <p>I learned how to use if and else statements and I have figured out how to make buttons properly. 
            I have started making a magic 8 ball for a khan acadamy project. 
            I did not learn what the difference is between if and else statments</p>
